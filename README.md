# EEPROM and Resource Files

This demo shows how romfiles and EEPROM memory work. These are the two places used for persistent data storage.

- Fill in the HTML form. The data will be saved into EEPROM memory, and will stay there after a restart.
- Verify the data by opening "login.html" and entering the correct usernames and passwords.
- Add, delete or edit user:password pairs by changing the ID.txt file within the project.
